        <p>
          Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for
          developing responsive, mobile-first websites. I use it most of the
          time because it's easy to use and very helpful.

          Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework.
          For me <span style="font-weight: bold;">angular</span> is the most
          powerful tool for front end developers. It's so well organized that
          you think you can do anything. If you learn how to use services,
          routes, forms and guards, you will be unstoppable :).

        <p>
          React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is
          used to build single page applications. React is good for use because
          it is flexible. My experience with
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">React</span> is good, i mostly manage
          my state with context api and hooks.
